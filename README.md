# Lab 1 - Using Jupyter Notebooks and Workflow for turning in Assignments

In this class we will be using Jupyter Notebooks for completing homeworks. This homework assignment will make sure you are comfortable using these tools. 

Jupyter notebooks are Java-Script Object Notation files that allow you to create documents to move and transport code and documentation that can be run interactively. The postfix for the file is `.ipynb`, you can think of this like a word document for python. 

In this homework assignment we want you to demonstrate your proficiency using this system. We will provide you some code that allows you to create your own personalized T-shirt logo.
